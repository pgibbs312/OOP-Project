# OOP-Project

#Project structure:
- see UML for specifics. The program is called from main.py. main.py then calls on maze and player to render the screen and blit it as the character moves, collects items, and interacts with the exit to either win if they have all the items or lose if they dont have all the items.

#Dependencies:
- win is called on if the players backpack contains all 4 items whn interacting witht the exit
- Loss is called when the player reaches the end but their backpack doesn't contain all 4 items

#How to run the program:
- In a virtual enviroment run the command "py main.py"
- This opens a window with the game inside it. The virtual enviroment that is still running will display what keys have been pressed. The game continues to run until either the player wins, the player loses or the window is closed.

#Controls:
- move left: left arrow
- move right: right arrow
- move up: up arrow
- move down: down arrow
