# OOP-Project

#Project structure:
-see UML for specifics. The program is called from main.py. main.py then calls on maze and player to render the screen and blit it as the character moves, collects items, and interacts with the exit to either win if they have all the items or lose if they dont have all the items.

#Dependencies:
- win depends on if the players backpack contains all 4 items (lose is if any of the items are missing)
- 

#How to run the program:
In a virtual enviroment run the command "py main.py"
This opens a window with the game inside it. The virtual enviroment that is still running will display what keys have been pressed. The game continues to run until either the player wins, the player loses or the window is closed.

#Controls:
move left: left arrow
move right: right arrow
move up: up arrow
move down: down arrow
